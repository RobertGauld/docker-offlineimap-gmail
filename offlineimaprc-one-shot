# OfflineImap caches the state of the synchronisation to e.g. be able to
# determine if a mail has been deleted on one side or added on the
# other.
#
# The default and historical backend is 'plain' which writes out the
# state in plain text files. On Repositories with large numbers of
# mails, the performance might not be optimal, as we write out the
# complete file for each change.  Another new backend 'sqlite' is
# available which stores the status in sqlite databases.

# If you have a limited amount of bandwidth available you can exclude larger
# messages (e.g. those with large attachments etc).  If you do this it
# will appear to offlineimap that these messages do not exist at all.  They
# will not be copied, have flags changed etc.  For this to work on an IMAP
# server the server must have server side search enabled.  This works with gmail
# and most imap servers (e.g. cyrus etc)
# The maximum size should be specified in bytes - e.g. 2000000 for approx 2MB
# maxsize = 2000000

# When you are starting to sync an already existing account you can tell
# offlineimap to sync messages from only the last x days.  When you do
# this messages older than x days will be completely ignored.  This can
# be useful for importing existing accounts when you do not want to
# download large amounts of archive email.
#
# Messages older than maxage days will not be synced, their flags will
# not be changed, they will not be deleted etc.  For offlineimap it will
# be like these messages do not exist.  This will perform an IMAP search
# in the case of IMAP or Gmail and therefor requires that the server
# support server side searching.  This will calculate the earliest day
# that would be included in the search and include all messages from
# that day until today.  e.g. maxage = 3 to sync only the last 3 days
# mail.
# maxage = 365

#Controls how many accounts may be synchronized simultaneously
